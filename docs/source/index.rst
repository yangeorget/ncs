Welcome to NUCS' documentation!
===================================

NUCS is a 100% Python library leveraging Numpy and Numba.

* **Python** is a powerful and flexible programing language that allows to express complex problems in a few lines of code.
* **Numpy** brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python.
* **Numba** translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library.
  Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.
