# NUCS

## Why Python ?
NUCS is a Python library leveraging Numpy and Numba.

Python is a powerful and flexible programing language that allows to express complex problems in a few lines of code.

Numpy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use.

Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. 
Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.
